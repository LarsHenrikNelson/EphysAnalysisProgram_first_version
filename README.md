# EphysAnalysisProgram

EphysAnalysisProgram is designed to analyze mEPSC/mIPSCs, current clamp and oEPSCs/LFPs from data acquired in ScanImage. This program is the first version of ClampSuite and mainly serves as a point of reference for how I shaped Clampsuite from the first non-script program iteration.
